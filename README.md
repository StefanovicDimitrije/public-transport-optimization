# Optimization of public transport
A full stack web application I've built as a project at my college with 3 other colleagues. 
The app is meant to simulate a real life application meant for a public transit company.
## The stack
We've used 

  1. NodeJs 

hooked up with

  2. ExpressJs
  3. Knex

for the backend. 

The frontend was mostly made using **Bootstrap** and **JavaScript Fetch requests**

## Installation

After you clone the repository, use npm to install the needed NodeJs packages

```bash
cd backend/javniPrevoz
npm install
```

After, if all the packages are installed, you can run

```bash
npm run start
```

to start your NodeJs server

## Usage 
Some of the functionalities of the app are:

  1. Buying a ticket
  2. Seeing bus stops and routes
  3. Rating drivers
  4. Viewing news
  5. Viewing changes
  6. Commenting on active threads
